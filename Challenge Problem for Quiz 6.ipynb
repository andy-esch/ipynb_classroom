      "<p style=\"font-size: 115%;\">A spring is used to launch a block up a rough incline. The spring constant is $1000\\,N/m$. You compress the spring $0.15\\,m$ and launch a $200\\,g$ block towards the incline. The horizontal surface is frictionless, but there is friction along the incline. Assume the block's coefficient of kinetic friction on the incline is 0.20. Find the distance $d$ that the block sails through the air.</p>\n",
